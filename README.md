# I'm Ashley Victor, and here is a little about me.
I started my career journey in bioinformatics and slowly started adding new disciplines, such as chemistry, pharmacogenomics, biology, and health informatics. As I keep learning how to apply informatics among the different sciences, I add my projects to this GitHub page! 

 

## Research
Here is a summary of what I've worked on and some of the questions I've tried to answer as a researcher.

1. How does epigenetic aging impact xenobiotic metabolism in mice and in humans? 💊🐁
2. When DNA is exposed to UV radiation, what is the impact on DNA's chemical structure? 🧬
3. Do we need to correct for bias when performing gene set enrichment analyses on fetal tissue? 👩🏻‍🍼
4. What is the relationship between the genetic risk of risky behaviors and impulsive actions in college students? 👩🏻‍🏫
5. How do we stay informed on the latest news in health informatics? How can we use the NCBI API as a tool to develop alerts on the latest publications in health informatics? 📰

## Teaching
I have taken up the role of a student and a teacher. These are some disciplines that I have taught...
1. Text Mining and Natural language processing in Python at the University of North Carolina- Chapel Hill at the [UNC DataAware Program](https://datamine.unc.edu/dataaware-training-modules/) 
2. Teaching Assistant for Informatics Courses:  
   a. Methods in Medical Informatics (Python)  
   b. Quality Improvement and Data Visualization (Tableau)  
   c. Databases in U.S. Healthcare (MySQL)  
   d. U.S. Healthcare System Course  
3. Tutor for Programming for Information Professionals (Python)
4. Tutor for Advanced Statistics and Organic Chemistry (at Virginia Commonwealth University)

## Work
I work as an informatics and data science intern for NC TraCS. Here I have been able to grow my skills as a data analyst. 
1. Developed a React Dashboard highlighting the available data sources that TraCS provides
2. Make data visualizations
