# I'm Ashley Victor, and here is a little about me.
I started my career journey in bioinformatics and slowly starting adding new disiciplines, such as chemistry, pharmacogenomics, biology and health informatics. As I keep learning how to apply informatics among the different sciences, I add my projects to this github page! Here is a summary of what I've worked on and some of the questions I've tried to answer as a researcher.

1. How does epigenetic aging impact xenobiotic metabolism in mice and in humans? 💊🐁
2. When DNA is exposed to UV radiation, what is the impact on DNA's chemical structure? 🧬
3. Do we need to correct for bias when performing gene set enrichment analyses on fetal tissue? 👩🏻‍🍼
4. What is the relationship between genetic risk of risky behaviors and implusive actions in college students? 👩🏻‍🏫
5. How do we stay informed on the latest news in health informatics? How can we use the NCBI API as a tool to develop alerts on the latest publications in health informatics? 📰

## I have taken up the role of a student and a teacher. These are some disciplines that I have taught...
